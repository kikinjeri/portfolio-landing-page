🌐 Developer Portfolio — Mwihaki Githii
A modern, minimal, and performance‑focused developer portfolio built with Next.js, designed to showcase full‑stack capabilities, UI/UX sensibility, and production‑ready engineering practices.

This project demonstrates the same skills and standards I bring to real‑world teams: clarity, structure, accessibility, and thoughtful design.
